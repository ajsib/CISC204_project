__Propositions__
e_ns = true if a card in hand has value n and suit s
k_i = true if hand has an i number of cards.
p_ns = true if piled card is value n and suit s
w = true if the sum of n's for all e_ns <= 7.
m_nq = e_ns has q cards with same value n in hand (group type 1 a)
sm_nq = p_ns has q cards with same value n that are in hand (group type 1 b)
f_sc = e_ns has c consecutive cards with same s in hand (group type 2 a)
sf_sc = p_ns has c consecutive cards with same s in hand (group type 2 b)
g_d = true if a group in hand has sum of n equal to d. e.g 2 hearts, 3 hearts, 4 hearts is a group with sum of n equal to 9.
d_g = true if g_d (or just g denoting this specific group) is the highest group in terms of d in the hand.
sg_d = true if a group in hand+pile has sum of n equal to d. 
sd_g = true if sg_d is the highest group in terms of sum d in hand+pile.
c = true when an d_g and a sd_g have at least one e_ns in common. 
(e.g 2 hearts, 3 hearts, 4 hearts is sd_g and 4 hearts is in hand, and then 4 hearts, 4 diamonds, and 4 spades is d_g)
vd = true when sd_g has higher sum d than d_g.
rx = d_g is put down on top of pile.
ry = best under d_g in hand is put down on top of pile.
us = true if pile card is picked up (option 1)
ud = true if random card from deck is picked up (option 2)
l = p_ns less than 7

__Constraints__ 
Card rules in general:
1<=i<=5, so the number of cards in hand is in between 1-5.
1<=n<=13, so n can only be ace, 1, 2,...,10, jack, queen, king.
1<=s<=4, so n can only be diamonds = 1, clubs = 2, hearts = 3, spades = 4.
every card has a unique suit and value combination assigned to it: e.g there can only be one e_71.

Rules of the game:
1<=q<=3, so the number of cards with the same n as a given e_ns or p_ns is limited to 1, 2 or 3 others.
2<=c<=4, so the number of cards consecutive to a given e_ns or p_ns with the same s is limited to 2, 3, or 4 others.
g_d <-> (m_nq \/ f_sc \/ e_ns) /\ !(m_nq /\ f_sc /\ e_ns) /\ !(m_nq /\ f_sc) /\ !(f_sc /\ e_ns)  /\ !(m_nq /\ e_ns) (these three things are just groups, categorized because they have different constraints placed on them, similar to one below)
sg_d <-> (sm_nq \/ sf_sc) /\ !(sm_nq /\ sf_sc)
d_g -> g_d (in order for g_d to be the highest, g_d needs to exist, similar to one below)
sd_g -> sg_d
w <-> e_71 \/ e_72 \/...\/ e_74 \/ (e_51 /\ e_11) \/ ... or any combination of cards in hand that adds up to a sum of n <=7.
c -> sd_g /\ d_g
ry <-> c /\ vd
rx <-> !c
l \/ (ry /\ g_d /\ d_g) \/ (rx /\ sg_d /\ sd_g) -> us 
!l <-> ud
